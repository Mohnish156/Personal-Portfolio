                I chose a career in Software Engineering because I enjoy problem solving and am very passionate about technology in general. I believe this field brings both these aspects together and would allow me to witness and be a part of new and innovative ideas. Software is also extremely important with almost every facet of our lives using it in one way or another which is why I want to develop a greater understanding of it, since it will be field in high demand for the foreseeable future.
                 Currently I am learning object oriented programming languages more specifically java, c++ aswell as kotlin. I am also learning about secure programming skills and how code must be done in a way as to avoid vulnerabilities and keep it secure. Another important subject I'm learning is network engineering which covers a range of topics including the essentials of data communication, computer network concepts, protocols, network applications and cloud computing.
               One quality that differentiates myself from others is that fact that I'm always willing to learn new things and improve my skills whenever they may be inadequate, furthermore I enjoy the process of getting better at something and have the patience and determination to see it through.
